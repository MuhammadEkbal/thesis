AS mentioned in \refSec{sec_oz_dynamic_oz}, the mobility in Dynamic \oz{} is achieved
by attaching a distinguished variable transferableOperation for location. Location transferring
is mimicked by assigning a new location to that variable. To translate the variable transferableOperation into \picalc{} we cannot use \picalc{} channel as in \refSec{sec_tra_mapping_state_variables}, since the value of transferableOperation will be a channel name and not a processes representing a value like $Zero$. Thus, we map the variable transferableOperation to channel named transferableOperation and:

\begin{itemize}
\item transferableOperation = nil is mapped to Nullref(transferableOperation).

\item transferableOperation = talk is mapped to Ref(transferableOperation,talk).
\end{itemize}
as shown in \refFig{tra_ref} \refLis{tra_ref_listing}
