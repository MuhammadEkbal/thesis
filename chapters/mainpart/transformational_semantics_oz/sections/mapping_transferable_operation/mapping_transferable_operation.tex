As mentioned in \refSec{sec_oz_dynamic_oz}, the mobility in Dynamic \oz{} is achieved
by attaching a distinguished variable transferableOperation for location. Location transferring
is mimicked by assigning a new location to that variable. To translate the variable \emph{transferableOperation} into the \picalc{} we cannot use \picalc{} channel as in \refSec{sec_tra_mapping_state_variables}, since the value of \emph{transferableOperation} will be a channel name and not a process representing a value like $Zero$. Thus, we map the variable transferableOperation to a channel named transferableOperation, where:

\begin{itemize}
\item transferableOperation = nil is mapped to Nullref(transferableOperation).

\item transferableOperation = talk is mapped to Ref(transferableOperation,talk).
\end{itemize}
as shown in \refFig{tra_ref} and \refLis{tra_ref_listing}.
\input{chapters/mainpart/transformational_semantics_oz/sections/mapping_transferable_operation/ref}
Thus, using the concept of transferable operation's variable we can now transform the classes \textit{IdleShop} and \textit{ActiveShop} as shown in \refFig{tra_idleShop_OZ}, \refLis{tra_idleShop_OZ_listing} and \refFig{tra_activeShop_OZ}, \refLis{tra_activeShop_OZ_listing}.

Finally, \refFig{tra_system_before}, \refFig{tra_system_after} and \refLis{tra_system_lis} show the big picture of a system consisting of two shops, a vending machine and a customer. The full implementation can be found in the appendix.
