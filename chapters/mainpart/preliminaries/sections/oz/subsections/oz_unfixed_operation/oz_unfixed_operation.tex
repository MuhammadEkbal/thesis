Let us have another look at \refFig{fig_oz_mobile_vending_machine_and_shops}. We can notice that before switching $Shop1$ was able to invoke the operation $talk$, but after switching this is not possible, since the link $talk$ moved to $Shop2$. In \oz{} words:
\begin{itemize}
\item Before switching:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $Shop1$: has the operation schema $talk$
	\item $Shop2$: doesn't have the operation schema $talk$
	\end{itemize}
\item By switching: $Shop1$ sends its operation schema $talk$ to $Shop2$.
\item After switching:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $Shop1$: doesn't have the operation schema $talk$
	\item $Shop2$: has the operation schema $talk$
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
That means, when we model the $talk$ operation in \oz{} we need to consider the following problems: 

\begin{itemize}
\item In \oz{}, it is not possible to send an \underline{operation} from $Shop1$ to $Shop2$.\\
\textbf{Solution:} By calling $talk$ an unfixed operation, and By using a state variable $t$ to store the name of the unfixed operation as shown in \refFig{fig_oz_unfixed_operation_schema_shop}.\\
By switching:
\begin{itemize}
\item $Shop1$ is the sender, so it sets its state variable $t$ to $nil$, which means the operation $talk$ is no more available on $Shop1$.
\item $Shop2$ is the receiver, so it sets its state variable $t$ to the value received from $Shop1$, .i.e., $talk$, which means: the operation $talk$ is now available on $Shop2$.
\end{itemize}
\item In \oz{}, it is not possible to send an \underline{operation schema} from $Shop1$ to $Shop2$.\\
\textbf{Solution:} Unfixed operation schema. To make the $talk$ operation schema in \refFig{fig_oz_overloaded_operation_shop} an unfixed operation schema, .i.e., a conditional operation schema as shown in \refFig{fig_oz_unfixed_operation_schema_shop}, it says: if $t = talk$ then this schema is the $talk$ operation schema, otherwise this schema doesn't exists.

\end{itemize}
