Let us have another look at \refFig{fig_oz_mobile_vending_machine_and_shops}. We can notice that before switching $Shop1$ was able to invoke the operation $talk$, but after switching this is not possible, since the link $talk$ moved to $Shop2$. In \oz{} words:
\begin{itemize}
\item Before switching:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $Shop1$: has the operation schema $talk$
	\item $Shop2$: doesn't have the operation schema $talk$
	\end{itemize}
\item By switching: $Shop1$ sends his operation schema $talk$ to $Shop2$.
\item After switching:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $Shop1$: doesn't have the operation schema $talk$
	\item $Shop2$: has the operation schema $talk$
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
. That means, when we model the $talk$ operation in \oz{} we need to consider that it some times exists and some times does not. We call $talk$ an unfixed operation. Thus, we need an unfixed operation schema. We need to rework the $talk$ operation schema in \refFig{fig_oz_overloaded_operation_shop} to make it an unfixed operation schema as shown in \refFig{fig_oz_unfixed_operation_schema_shop}. The new schema is an conditional schema, it says: if $t = talk$ then this schema is $talk$ operation schema, otherwise this schema doesn't exists.
