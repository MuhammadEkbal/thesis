Imagine a mobile vending machine $VM$ connected by wireless link $talk$ to a shop $Shop1$. On signal fading the $Shop1$ decides to send the link $talk$ to another shop $Shop2$ through the link $switch$ as shown in \refFig{fig_oz_mobile_vending_machine_and_shops}. \oz{} can be used to model the shop. But, the operation $switch$ has a dual nature. It plays the sender role in $Shop1$, and the receiver role in $Shop2$.
 In \oz{} to deal with the duality nature we introduce the concept of \findex{Operation schema overloading}. As in some programming languages, method overloading is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations. That is, the operation $switch$ has two different specifications ,i.e. two operation schemas with the same name as shown in \refFig{fig_oz_overloaded_operation_shop}, the first for sending and the second for receiving.
