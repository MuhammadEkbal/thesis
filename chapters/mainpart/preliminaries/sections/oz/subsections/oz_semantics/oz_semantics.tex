To understand the operational semantics of \oz{} we will use  a labelled transition system LTS. Using this LTS we can investigate the state evolution of a \oz{} object . The definition of this LTS is adapted from \refDef{def_pi_trans_system} with some changes.

\begin{definition}[LTS of \oz{}]
\label{def_oz_trans_system}
The labelled transition system $(\stats,\traces)$ of \oz{} class states over the set of operations, has the valid states $\stats$ as its states and its transitions $\traces$ are those which can be inferred from the following rule: \\$\underline{\scriptstyle{OPER}}: PRE\_STATE \transs{operation} POST\_STATE$.
\end{definition}
An example of using the transition rule of this LTS is: drawing the transition graph of vending machine shown in  \refFig{oz_vm_with_all_specifications}. The transition graph is shown in \refFig{fig_VM_transition_graph}, where we show only a small part of it. The transitions $coffee$ and $tea$ refer to the operation schema $coffee$ and $tea$. Thus, using the LTS we can enumerate all possible states transitions of an \oz{} state.
