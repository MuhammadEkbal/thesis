Syntactically the $\pi$-OZ specification is divided into an interface, a $\pi$ part and an \oz{} part as shown in \refFig{PpiOZ}.
The idea of the combination is that communication
in the $\pi$ part has effects on the state space of the \oz{} part as specified in its operation schema. \refFig{comp_oz_pi_statefull_vm} shows the $\pi$-OZ specification of our vending machine $VM$.
In the interface, all channels are declared with the associated types.
The $\pi$ part is a system of recursive equations written according to the \picalc{} syntax represents the sequencing of operations
as shown in $VM\_PI$.
In the OZ part the state space, the initial schema and the operation schemes introduced, where the operation schemes defines the effect of communications on the in specified channels.
