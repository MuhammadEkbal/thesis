\todo{instead of just traces is not nice}The failures semantics collects instead of just traces, tuple of traces and a set of so-called failures. These failure sets describe for the process reachable with the respected trace and if no internal transition is possible, which transitions cannot be used for the next step. This takes the internal behavior of a process into account.

Like the trace semantics, the failures semantics do not really differ from the definition of Roscoe and this section has a similar structure as the previous one.
