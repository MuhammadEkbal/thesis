every entity has a behavior and data. behavior actions can have effects on data. to model this idea we will break down our entity into two components: behavior component and data component.
behavior component: represent the behavior that can an entity do during it's life cycle.
data component: represents the data of an entity and the changes that can be made on it.
we use pi calculus which is a specification language to model the behavior component.
we use oz which is a specification language to model the data components.
since pi and oz are two different languages used to descripe different aspects of entity, we need a way to put them togher to get the model a complete entity.
this is done using a simple trick. the trick is: transforming the oz into a pi language. this way we will have :
behavior component: in pi.
data component: in pi too.
this way we can let them play together to represent an entity which have two view: behavior and data.
